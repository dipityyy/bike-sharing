## Deliverable 2:

Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

Deliverable Requirements:

Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.
